# DEFINITIONS

## Abstractions
Hiding all information about an object to the user, except what is necessary.

## Attributes/Properties
Data associated with an object. For example the data accessed through getters and setters.

## Class
User made data type that holds anything the user wants. Has access to its own user defined methods.

## Class Variable
Variable defined in and is only accessible to a class.

## Composition
Complex objects made up of other objects or data types.

## Encapsulation
Grouping data from a class and the methods that can access them.

## Friends
Function that is given permissions to act in a class like a method, with access to private methods and data.

## Inheritance
A child class inherits properties or methods from a parent class.

## Instance variable
Similar to a class variable, but has a different value for each instance of the class. Class variables are always the same value.

## Member variable
Variable associated with an object, and is accessible to all the object's methods.

## Method
Function that belongs to an object, only accessible with that object.

## Multiple inheritance
Object that inherits properties or characteristics from multiple parent objects.

## Object
A structure or data type that holds other data.

## Overloading
Declaring something multiple times with different parameters. For example making the same function twice but one for ints and one for doubles.

## Polymorphism
Ability to handle or operate with different data types.

## Public / Private / Protected
### Public
Available everywhere
### Private
Available only within the same class
### Protected
Available within subclasses as well.

## Virtual
Object that is declared in a class but can be overridden in derived classes.
